#### Yating's Contribution

# Implementation
I implemented one initial implement and test my own codes for Problem 2 into the branch[YH-P2](https://gitlab.cs.mcgill.ca/mnassif/303a6t26/-/tree/YH-P2)

I created a Merge Request to let teammates review [Yating Problem2(Team member 6)](https://gitlab.cs.mcgill.ca/mnassif/303a6t26/-/merge_requests/6)
This also includes one diagram that I did for my initial implementation. 

I just thought about the individual Problem while implementing so that it's not a quite complete implementation for the overall activity and we didn't use it.

# Test
I created a test for Problem 1 into branch [YH](https://gitlab.cs.mcgill.ca/mnassif/303a6t26/-/tree/YH)

# Review
I reviewed Problem 3 and created a ![ClassDiagram](/files/P3Diagram.png)
